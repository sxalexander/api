# SteamCMD API

Read-only API interface for steamcmd app_info. Updates of this code are
automatically deployed on Fly.io via [Github Actions](https://github.com/steamcmd/api/actions)
when a new version has been created on Github.

## Self-hosting

The easiest way to host the API yourself is using the free cloud platform
[Fly.io](https://fly.io). Install the CLI according to the documentation:
[https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/).

After installing, authenticate locally with the `flyctl` cli:
```bash
fly auth login
```
Create the app and redis instances (choose your own names):
```bash
fly apps create <app-name>
fly redis create <redis-name>
```
Retrieve the Redis connection URL (you will need this later):
```bash
fly redis status <redis-name>

Redis
  ID             = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  Name           = api
  Plan           = Free
  Primary Region = ams
  Read Regions   = None
  Eviction       = Enabled
  Private URL    = redis://default:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@fly-api.upstash.io   <== Write the password down
```
Set the required configuration environment variables:
```bash
fly secrets set --app <app-name> \
  CACHE=True \
  CACHE_TYPE=redis \
  CACHE_EXPIRATION=120 \
  REDIS_HOST="fly-api.upstash.io" \
  REDIS_PORT=6379 \
  REDIS_PASSWORD="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```
Finally deploy the API Docker image with the latest code:
```bash
fly deploy --app <app-name> --image steamcmd/api:latest -e VERSION=1.0.0
```
The version is optional and currently only required for the `/v1/version` endpoint.

## Container

The API can easily be run via a Docker image which contains the API code and the
`uvicorn` tool to be able to respond to web requests. With every new version of
the API the Docker images is automatically rebuild and pushed to the Docker Hub:
```bash
docker pull steamcmd/api:latest
```
```bash
docker pull steamcmd/api:1.10.0
```
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -d steamcmd/api:latest
```
However during development, using Docker Compose is preferred. See the
[Development](#development) section for information.

## Configuration

When hosting the API yourself there are few settings you can change to configure
the API to your platform specifications. The easiest way is to create an `.env`
file in the `src/` directory. Alternatively setting environment variables is
possible as well.

All the settings are optional. Keep in mind that when you choose a cache type
that you will need to set the corresponding cache settings for that type as well
(ex.: `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `REDIS_PASSWORD` is required when using the
**redis** type).

All the available options in an `.env` file:
```
# general
VERSION=1.0.0

# caching
CACHE=True
CACHE_TYPE=redis
CACHE_EXPIRATION=120

# redis
REDIS_HOST="your.redis.host.example.com"
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD="YourRedisP@ssword!"

# OR, if your host provides a [Connection URL](https://redis-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#quickly-connecting-to-redis)
REDIS_URL="redis://YourUsername:YourRedisP@ssword!@your.redis.host.example.com:6379"

# deta
DETA_BASE_NAME="steamcmd"
DETA_PROJECT_KEY="YourDet@ProjectKey!"
```

## Development

Run the api locally by installing a web server like uvicorn and running it:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install uvicorn
cd src/
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The easiest way to spin up a complete development environment is using Docker
compose. This will build the image locally, mount the correct directory (`src`)
and set the required environment variables. If you are on windows you should
store the repository in the WSL filesystem or it will fail. Execute compose up
in the root:
```bash
docker compose up
```
Now you can reach the SteamCMD API locally on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### Black

To keep things simple, [Black](https://github.com/python/black) is used for code
style / formatting. Part of the pipeline will check if the code is properly
formatted according to Black code style. You can install it locally via pip:
```bash
pip install black
```
And then simply run it agains the Python source code:
```bash
black src
```
